## Getting Started

1. Navigate to /server
2. (Assuming Docker is installed on the platform) Run:\
   `docker-compose up -d`\
   This may take a few minutes the first time it runs.
3. Once finished, use:\
   `docker ps`\
   To display a table of currently running Docker containers. Copy the container ID of the image "shouts.dev/laravel"
4. Next, run:\
   `docker exec <container-ID> composer install`\
   `docker exec <container-ID> php artisan --version`\
   `docker exec <container-ID> php artisan migrate`

5. The API will be running on http://localhost:80.  Test fetches can be made to the API using Telnet or curl.  For example, making a POST request with the fields "name", "email", "password", "c_password" to http://localhost:80. The API can be started or stopped in the Docker program window (the container is named "server")

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
